# Data Analysis 101: Python Notebooks for Clinical Data

This repository contains three structured and beginner-friendly Python notebooks designed to teach the fundamentals of programming, data manipulation, and applied machine learning using real-world clinical data. These notebooks are ideal for learners in healthcare, data science, or AI who want to work with patient datasets in a reproducible, ethical, and modern Python environment.

Each notebook is designed to run seamlessly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), so you don’t need to install anything locally.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Python 101 – Foundations of Python Programming
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Salkimmich/data_analysis_101/blob/main/Python_101_HuggingFace_Colab_Compatible.ipynb)

Learn core Python concepts:
- Variable assignment and dynamic typing
- Functions, control flow, and loops
- Error handling with `try/except`
- Importing libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`
- Loading structured data using the Hugging Face Datasets library
- Saving files (CSV/JSON) for reproducible analysis

### 2. Python 102 – Data Manipulation and Visualization
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Salkimmich/data_analysis_101/blob/main/Python_102_Data_Manipulation.ipynb)

Build real-world skills in:
- Python data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- File I/O (CSV, TXT) using pandas
- Data cleaning: handling missing values, filtering, sorting
- Grouping and pivoting datasets
- Creating basic plots with `matplotlib`
- Working directly with patient records from `patjs/patient1`

### 3. Python 103 – Applied AI Readiness for Healthcare
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Salkimmich/data_analysis_101/blob/main/Python_103_AI_Readiness.ipynb)

Develop AI-ready pipelines:
- Introduction to `scikit-learn` and machine learning basics
- Preprocessing: encoding categorical variables, scaling, normalization
- Building ML pipelines (with Logistic Regression)
- Calling external APIs using Python
- Organizing notebooks for reproducibility
- A mini-project to create a simple risk classifier

---

## Data Source

All patient data used is synthetic and publicly available via:
**[Hugging Face Datasets – patjs/patient1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/patjs/patient1)**  
It is generated for ethical testing and education.
