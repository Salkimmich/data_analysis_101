He reminds everyone to complete a competency assessment by scanning a QR code and mentions that they would give a few more minutes for latecomers to join before starting the program.\n\nNick introduces the agenda, highlighting that the week will focus on problem definition and the project's scope, including the AI application they will work on, which involves creating a review platform. The discussion covers the importance of understanding the background of AI, various training methods, and common pitfalls in AI projects. Participants are reminded that AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and the session underscores the need for proper data management, understanding limitations, and the ethical implications of AI usage.\n\nNick and Arno (the lead lecturer) explain supervised and unsupervised learning, emphasizing that supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabelled data, such as clustering. They also discuss generative AI and its applications, such as automating customer service inquiries.\n\nThe lecture addresses common failures in AI projects, reiterating the significance of clearly defined problems, the availability and quality of data, and the appropriate use of technology. Nick encourages participants to actively participate in workshops, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and feedback.\n\nFinally, participants are encouraged to engage with their assigned groups for project collaboration and to prepare for upcoming workshops by reviewing the provided learning materials.\n\nOverall, the session aims to equip attendees with foundational knowledge of AI, the importance of ethical considerations, and the practical approach required for upcoming projects and workshops."

Calculate the opposite side:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{144} = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the adjacent side:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{25} = 5\n   \\]\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- Opposite side \\(a = 12\\)\n- Adjacent side \\(b = 5\\)\n\nNext, we want to find the hypotenuse \\(c\\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\n\\[\n12^2 + 5^2 = c^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(12^2\\) and \\(5^2\\):\n\n\\[\n144 + 25 = c^2\n\\]\n\nAdding these:\n\n\\[\n169 = c^2\n\\]\n\nNow, we take the square root to find \\(c\\):\n\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{169} = 13\n\\]\n\nThus, the missing side (the hypotenuse) in the right triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]"
