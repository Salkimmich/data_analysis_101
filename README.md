# NumPy and Pandas Tutorial with Real-World NLP Application

## Overview

Welcome! This repository is designed as an **educational journey** through two of Python's most powerful libraries‚Äî**NumPy** and **Pandas**‚Äîto help you understand and apply data transformation techniques in practical settings.

We begin by exploring the foundational concepts in structured data transformation using NumPy and Pandas in `just_pandas_and_numpy.ipynb`. Once you're comfortable with the tools and techniques, we move on to `numpy_and_python_for_NLP.ipynb`, where you‚Äôll see how these skills transfer seamlessly to **real-world NLP (Natural Language Processing)** problems.

> üìö This tutorial is designed for alearners who want to build *real intuition* about how numerical and textual data are transformed in data science workflows.

## Learning Path

### üìò Step 1: Learn the Fundamentals
**Notebook: `just_pandas_and_numpy.ipynb`**

This notebook focuses on helping you understand how to:
- Work with **arrays** and **Series**
- Clean and transform data
- Apply logical conditions and vectorized operations
- Create and analyze groupings of structured data

**Example from the notebook**:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

data = np.array([[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60]])
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['A', 'B', 'C'])

# Add a new column using NumPy vectorized operations
df['D'] = np.mean(data, axis=1)
```

‚úÖ You‚Äôll learn:
- The difference between NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames
- How to use broadcasting and slicing effectively
- How to create derived columns and summarize structured data

This section is great for building your *data intuition*‚Äîunderstanding how each operation changes the structure and meaning of your dataset.

### üìô Step 2: Apply the Fundamentals to NLP
**Notebook: `numpy_and_python_for_NLP.ipynb`**

Now that you‚Äôve built a strong foundation, this notebook shows you how to apply your knowledge to analyze **real-world textual data**. We work with survey responses and apply:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning)
- TF-IDF vectorization using NumPy
- Clustering techniques like KMeans
- Interpretation using Pandas DataFrames

**Example from the notebook**:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Turn text into a matrix of TF-IDF features
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['response_text'])

# Convert to NumPy array for further computation
X_array = X.toarray()

# Calculate average TF-IDF score for each response
avg_tfidf = np.mean(X_array, axis=1)
df['avg_tfidf'] = avg_tfidf
```

‚úÖ You‚Äôll learn:
- How to use Pandas to store and manipulate text data
- How to use NumPy to apply efficient mathematical operations on vectorized text
- How to cluster and categorize text using learned features

This section shows how Pandas and NumPy aren't just abstract tools‚Äîthey are **core to making real-world data problems solvable**.

## Why Learn in This Order?

We intentionally start with `just_pandas_and_numpy.ipynb` to help you focus on **data structure transformation**, **logical operations**, and **aggregation**. Once you're confident with those skills, we move into `numpy_and_python_for_NLP.ipynb` to demonstrate how **those same patterns** apply to unstructured data like text.

By the end, you‚Äôll understand:
- How to use NumPy and Pandas to manipulate both numbers and text
- How to switch between structured and unstructured data workflows
- How foundational transformations enable clustering, vectorization, and analysis
